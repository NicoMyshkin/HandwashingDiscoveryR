# Handwashing Discovery in R

In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing. It includes data analysis, data visualization, and confidence intervals calculation. 

The doctors didn't wash their hands increased the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval. All in all, it would seem that Semmelweis had solid evidence that handwashing was a simple but highly effective procedure that could save many lives. Akthough the medical community largely rejected his discovery and in 1849 he was forced to leave the Vienna General Hospital for good, if he would have had access to the analysis in this Jupyter Notebook he might have been more successful in getting the Viennese doctors to wash their hands.
